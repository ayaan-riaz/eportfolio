	<h1>Black Box Investigation</h1>
	<h3>By: Ayaan Riaz</h3>
	<h4>Introduction/Background Information</h4>
	<p>The mystery Black Box a creation of  Mr. Sinusas. The inside of the box is unknown but with tests I will get a basic idea of what the inside is. You pour water in the top of the funnel (input) and water comes out of the bottom hole/pipe (output). I am trying to replicate the Mystery Black Box and will build a real life model and 3d model in maya as well.</p>
	<h1>Claim</h1>
	<p>I think that the Black Box contains a tipping bucket mechanism. The water will enter from a funnel and be poured into a bucket. As the bucket fills it will rotate and pour the water into a separate container from which the water will drain and exit the box via a tube. This would mimic the Mystery Black Box’s randomness in the amount of water exiting the box.</p>
	<h1>Evidence</h1>
	<p>The tipping bucket mechanism contains a bucket with a rod/axle on one side. The bucket also has a counterweight on that side where the axle is so it stays in an upright position. As the bucket fills with water, the weight causes it to tip and release the water into another container from which the water will be drained out of the black box model via a tube. We collected data from the Black Box by adding a measured amount of water and measuring how much of that water exited the Black Box. When we created our model we got a box, two buckets, two hoses different in size, one smaller than the other, two funnels, an axle/bamboo stick, and some counterweight. We used tools like scissors, tape, and a drill. We attached a hose/pipe to the funnel and inserted it in a box. Then we got a bucket with the axle and counterweight attached and poked it through the box so it could swing with the weight of water. We then had another bucket under the swinging bucket so it could catch the water and a hole to lead it into a funnel which had another hose attached to it so the water could then exit the box. We also noticed that the black box made a water pouring noise and so did ours so we were on the right track. For example in one of our trials we poured in 1,000 mL of water and none came out but then in another trial we added around 500 mL of water and a whole bunch came out. It was more than we added as if the water from the first and second pour were combined. Similar to the Mystery Black Box.</p>

	<h1>Reasoning</h1>
	<h2>Reasoning Part I</h2>
	<p>We are using a tilting mechanism so the amount of water exiting the bucket will be different than the input water. This is because the bucket will need to be filled first and then would tip due to the weight of water. However, as the water gets released the bucket will return to its original position. There will still be water in the bucket meaning less water exited the black box than the amount that entered. To add more randomness, we were thinking of adding a mechanism which would make the bucket slowly return to the original position so that it could allow water to flow through differently every test.</p>
	<h2>Reasoning Part II</h2>
	<p>Our evidence supports our claim because our model performed closely to the black box. However it was different because of the size and the fact we weren’t able to attach hydraulics or springs with the limited materials and resources provided.</p>
	<h2>Reasoning Part III</h2>
	<p>The data would be different if the mechanism was a ball which lifts up a flap as the water level goes up to release the water because then it would release the same amount of water with only a little bit of change between tests. It would also leak a lot of water which was noticed by the Mystery Black Box but the Mystery Black Box did not leak as much water as that idea would. The Mystery Black Box also released the water gradually while that idea would release it suddenly.</p>

<h1>Real Life Model</h1>
	<p>During this project the first thing I created was a real life model of my idea of what happens in the Mystery Black Box. I and my group created a working model. It could have been better but it showed my idea of what happened in the Black Box. We also tested the Mystery Black Box and while testing tried to replicate this in our real life model. After creating this we also did a test using a thermal camera.</p>

	<h1>Maya 2025 3d Render</h1>
	<p>After creating a real life model of the Mystery Black Box, I created a 3d render using Maya. The 3d render showed bassically the same thing except it was more customizable and there wasnt a need to worry about issues like the box not being water proof. However, before I even started making this 3d model, I had to do some pictionary games on Maya to build up my skills. Some of the things I was great at making and really liked was the iPhone, the mouse, and the working door. As you can see in the images below, I was also able to add fluid dynamic on my Maya 3D render which was really nice. In the video below, you can see the render of my Black Box Model with the fluid dynamics. You might notice the wtaer going through some of the blocks and that is because some of the objects weren't able to be created as a passive collider (some objects didn't have collisions enabled) because if it were to be enabled it would prevent the water fluid from working.</p>

<h1>Augmented Realty</h1>
	<p>After completing my Maya 3D model, I created an augmented reality of my 3d render.
	Augmented realty, also known as AR, is used to show what your model would look like in real life using your camera.
	It will use a flat surface or a cube, like the one in the image below, to show your model
	on the screen using a computer camera, phone camera, or a tablet.
	As you can see in the first few images there was a block covering the view.
	This was used for the water to make sure it would go in the right location.
	On Maya I made them invisable but on Adobe Aero, the program I used for AR render, it showed the block.
	It still showed the basic idea of the 3d model
	(<a href="https://adobeaero.app.link/dOdqMf6e7Nb" target="_blank">Adobe Aero Link</a>).
	However, on Merge.edu, another program used for AR rendering the pieces were more invisable
	(<a href="https://objects.mergeedu.com/link/6RKNL0" target="_blank">MergeEdu Link</a>).
	The first qr code below is for MergeEdu AR viewing and the second one is for Adobe Aero AR viewing.</p>

<h1>21st Century Skills I Developed</h1>
<p>During this project, I developed many skills. A 21st century skill that I developed is Critical Thinking and Problem Solving. Critical thinking was necessary to figure out what was happening inside the Mystery Black Box. Real scientists do not know what happens when they have questions. They need to figure out the correct answer and do experiments using their critical thinking skills. This project developed that skill of mine. Another skill that was developed is problem solving. While creating the model, I encountered many problems, especially with the limited amount of materials available. I had to make sure we could create our model and solve any issues along the way. The biggest issue was the tipping bucket mechanism. The bucket would tilt the wrong way. To fix this problem I used my critical thinking skills to figure out a way to add a counterweight without ruining the design. This was one of many issues but I persevered and solved the problems to finish the black box model.
</p>


	<h1>Personal Reflection</h1>
<p>During this entire quarter, I and my group tried to mimic the Myster Black Box created by Kevin Sinusas. We first ran multiple tests on the Mystery Black Box trying to get an idea of what might be happening inside. After we had a basic idea of what happened inside, we made a diagram of what we think happens inside the Mystery Black Box. After we confirmed that we wanted to use this idea, we made a real life model and tested it. The real life model did have some limitations as reality is different then our imagination, but we were able to make our idea work and deemed our model a success. All of this led to the creation of my Maya 3d render. The same one you say in the 3d sections. Creating the Maya 3d render was reallly fun and creating the real life model was also fun. To build up my Maya skills I did some Maya pictionary which involved creating 3d models of things from a pictionary card. Basically like pictionary except we make a 3d model. Also in my 3d model I made animations to show where the water would go and how the objects in my model would move. After this I used an online program which is MergeEdu and Adobe Aero to show my 3d Model in real life (augmented reality). All of this led to the creation of what your looking at right now. My webpage! I had to create this webpage from scratch. I added all these image, qr codes, the design, and the videos. If you right click on your mouse or click your trackpad using two fingers you will see a menu and if you select inspect you will be able to see all the code that I wrote to make this webpage work. Quite amazing isn't it? </p>
